In this Project :

Take up three classification algorithms of your own choice and 
build three respective Machine learning models. 
Compare the Accuracy of all three 
and suggest which ML algorithms suits best for the given problem.

ask any two questions on the dataset of your choice and 
provide answers for the same. 
For instance for the given dataset questions can be as follows.

Q1) What are the most common emotions/words used by Males and Females?
