In this Project :

Take up three classification algorithms of your own choice and <br>
build three respective Machine learning models.<br> 
Compare the Accuracy of all three <br>
and suggest which ML algorithms suits best for the given problem.<br>
<br>
ask any two questions on the dataset of your choice and<br> 
provide answers for the same. <br>
For instance for the given dataset questions can be as follows.<br>
<br>
<br>
